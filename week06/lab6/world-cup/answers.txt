Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Mostly the top of the list. Teams with the lowest ratings scored consistently at the bottom, especially those close to 0%

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: The sweet spot seemed to be 10000 simulations. Percentages remained pretty accurate, without too much impact on timing.
